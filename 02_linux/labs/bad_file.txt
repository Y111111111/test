=====vi is a scre_n-oriented text _ditor orig=inally created for the Unix
operating system. The portable subset of the beha=vior of vi and programs
based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs,
is descr=ibed by (and thus stand_rdized by) the Single Unix Specification
and POSIX.

The orig_nal co=de for vi was written by Bill Joy in 19=76, as the visual
mode fo=r a line e_itor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck
Haley. Bi=ll Joy's ex 1.1 was releas_d as part of the first BSD Unix
release in Mar_h, 1978. 

The name vi is der=ived from the shortest unambiguous ab_reviation for
the command visual in ex; the command in qu=estion switches the line
editor ex to vi_ual mo=de. The name vi is pronounced (as in the discrete
English letters v and i).

In addition to va=rious non-free software implementations of vi
distributed with proprietar_ implementat=ions of Unix, several free and
open source software implementatio_s of vi exist. A 20=09 survey of Linux
Journal readers foun_ that v=i was the most widely used text editor among
respondents, beating gedit, the second most widely used editor by nearly
a factor of two (36% to 19%).=====
