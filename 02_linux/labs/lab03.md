# Lab 3 - File manipulation

1. Create empty files: `contact.html`, `style.css,`and create folders: `backend`, `frontend`
2. Copy a file named `contact.html` to `index.html`.
3. Move `index.html` and `style.css` to the directory named `frontend`.
4. Remove the file named `contact.html`.
5. Now your `frontend` folder should contains 2 files
6. Try to remove the directory named `frontend` with rmdir and explain why it does or doesn't work.
Remove `frontend` including its contents using the right command.
